The National Center for Learning Disabilities reports that 1 in 5 people in the United States experience learning differences, including dyslexia and ADHD. With this in mind, educators often build lessons with multiple means of engagement to provide multiple access points to content within a single lesson. 

Universal Design for Learning is a popular methodology for ensuring students are given multiple pathways across a standards-aligned lesson.Â 
Recently, I began testing, and tuning prompts to leverage ChatGPT as a pseudo-coding partner to improve my Python programming knowledge. After building prompts to identify and build a reproducible protocol for wrangling data in python, I decided to attempt to craft a UDL Lesson for an introduction to Python programming leveraging the output from ChatGPT.

|Lesson Objective(s):| The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive overview of basic data types and variables in Python and equip participants with the skills to write clean, PEP8 compliant, and DRY code.                             |
|:-------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Assessment(s):      | Students will be able to load, clean, and analyze data from a csv file in Python|
|State Standard(s):  | Students will be able to load, clean, and analyze data from a csv file in Python|

## Introduction:

The first step in learning Python for data science is getting familiar with basic data types and variables. 

- Start by launching a Jupyter Notebook and creating a new cell.

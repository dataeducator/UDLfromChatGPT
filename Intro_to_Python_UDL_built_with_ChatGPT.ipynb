    "# Using ChatGPT to build a Lesson using Universal Design for Learning \n",
    "The National Center for Learning Disabilities reports that 1 in 5 people in the United States experience learning differences, including dyslexia and ADHD.  With this in mind, educators often build lessons with multiple means of engagement to provide multiple access points to content within a single lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Universal Design for Learning](https://www.cast.org/impact/universal-design-for-learning-udlis) is a popular methodology for ensuring students are given multiple pathways across a standards-aligned lesson.  Recently, I began testing, and tuning prompts to leverage ChatGPT as a pseudo-coding partner to improve my Python programming knowledge. After building prompts to identify and build a reproducible protocol for wrangling data in python, I decided to attempt to craft a UDL Lesson for an introduction to Python programming leveraging the output from ChatGPT.\n",

    "|Lesson Objective(s):|\tThe purpose of this lesson is to provide a comprehensive overview of basic data types and variables in Python and equip students with the skills to write clean, PEP8 compliant, and DRY code.|\n",

    "There are certain data types are fundamental to writing programs in Python, and understanding how to work with them is an important step in learning how to code in this language. \n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>int</code>: An integer data type used to represent whole numbers. For example, 1, 2, 3, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>float</code>: A floating-point data type used to represent real numbers. For example, 1.0, 2.5, 3.14, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>str</code>: A string or object data type used to represent text data. For example, \"Hello, World!\", \"python\", etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>bool</code>: A Boolean data type used to represent truth values (True or False).\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>list</code>: A collection data type used to store an ordered sequence of elements. For example, [1, 2, 3], [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"], etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>tuple</code>: An immutable collection data type used to store an ordered sequence of elements. For example, (1, 2, 3), (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>dict</code>: A dictionary data type used to store key-value pairs. For example, {\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30}, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>set</code> A set data type used to store unique elements. For example, {1, 2, 3}, {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in learning Python for data science is getting familiar with basic data types and variables.\n",
